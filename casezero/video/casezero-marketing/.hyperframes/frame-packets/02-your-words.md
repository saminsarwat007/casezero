## Frame 2 — Your words, your evidence

- scene: The camera travels across the real composer from the user's wording field to the PDF evidence area.
- voiceover: "Case Zero changes that. Write what happened in your own words, then attach the evidence you already have."
- duration: 8.229s
- poster: 7.4s
- transition_in: zoom-through
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/02-your-words.html
- type: product_intro
- persuasion: Friction reduction

- blueprint: prompt-type-submit-generate (Adapt)
- asset_candidates: assets/composer.png — real CaseZero complaint composer in its empty state
- focal: assets/composer.png
- roles: composer.png = cutout
- sfx: none

narrativeRole: Show that the customer starts with their own account and their own evidence.
keyMessage: CaseZero follows the user’s complaint instead of replacing it with seeded data.

Adapt: keep the composer-as-gravitational-center signature; do not fabricate typing or a response state—move only across the verified still capture.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.8s): Soft-bone field; the real composer lands as an oversized crisp surface filling the right 72%, with “CASEZERO / COMPLAINT” as tiny mono chrome at top left — surface establish with a smooth long-tail settle (`spring-pop-entrance`, zero overshoot), asymmetric 28/72.
Scene 2 (1.8–4.5s): As “your own words” is spoken, one purposeful zoom-to-target isolates the real wording field; “Your words.” reveals at left in display type — coordinate target zoom (`coordinate-target-zoom`) and per-word stagger (`dynamic-content-sequencing`).
Scene 3 (4.5–6.7s): At “attach the evidence,” the camera makes one velocity-matched lateral reframe to the real PDF upload region; “Your evidence.” replaces the left line with burgundy punctuation — pan/focus-lock (`viewport-change`) with a cut-the-curve seam.
Scene 4 (6.7–8.229s): Reframe to the full composer and hold; both verified entry points are visible, with no fake interaction and no movement.

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ZOOM_SCALE | 1.5× modest → 3× dominant → 5×+ extreme | cap via the headroom budget; raster media needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × ZOOM_SCALE` |
| ZOOM_DUR   | 1.0–2.0s                                | under 0.8s feels like a teleport, over 2.5s drags; both tweens share it                    |
| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

## Selected motion rule: dynamic-content-sequencing

description: Auto-calculate timeline start/end times from content length + per-item duration config — longer content gets more screen time without hardcoded numbers.
metadata:
  tags: timeline, sequencing, dynamic, duration, content-aware, utility

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html

<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta" id="cta">{ctaUrl}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any non-1.0 scale reveals edges or pushes content off-frame */
  background: {bgGradient}; /* on .scene, NOT .world — a world-borne background warps with the camera */
}
.world {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

tl.to(
  cam,
  {
    scale: TARGET_SCALE,
    y: counterY,
    duration: ZOOM_DUR,
    ease: "power3.inOut",
    onUpdate: applyCamera,
  },
  ZOOM_START,
);
```

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
